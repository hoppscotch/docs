# Interceptor

You can access APIs blocked by CORS restriction by using either Proxyscotch or custom middleware. You can also use the Hoppscotch web extension.

## Proxy

![Proxy](/features/proxy.png)

- Enable proxy in settings.
- You can replace this with your own proxy middleware if you wish.

## Middleware

Since CORS is as simple as adding some HTTP headers, and itâ€™s the only browser blocked. You can build some proxy-like component that will basically make a call for you and get the response from the desired API. You add it to the headers, and then send it back to Hoppscotch.

## Browser extension

2. Enable it in settings.
3. Open the extension and add new origins.
4. Hoppscotch extension routes all added origins to Proxy.

# Prerequisites

Hoppscotch is a self-hosted API development platform, packaged as a set of Docker containers. You can install and run Hoppscotch on any operating system that can run a [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine). You can use Hoppscotch on your local machine or a cloud provider of your choice.

## Enterprise License Key

To start using Hoppscotch Enterprise, you will need to purchase a license from the [Hoppscotch Enterprise Store](https://enterprise.hoppscotch.com). Once you have purchased a license, you will receive an email with the license key. You can also find the license key in your [Hoppscotch Enterprise Dashboard](https://enterprise.hoppscotch.com/dashboard).

## System Requirements

Hoppscotch is designed to run well on both small and large deployments. The minimum requirements to run Hoppscotch are an operating system that supports Docker and 4 CPU cores + 4GB of RAM to generate the build image and as little as 1 CPU core + 2GB of RAM to host the generated output files.

## Install Node.js, npm, pnpm

### Node.js + npm

Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18+) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com) (v9+).

Verify Node.js and npm installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
npm -v
```

### pnpm

Install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) (v6+).

## Docker

Install [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com) (v20+).

It is recommended to use Compose V2. To switch to Compose V2, use the `docker compose` CLI plugin or activate the **Use Docker Compose V2** setting in Docker Desktop. For more information, see the [Evolution of Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-v2).

## Git

Install [`Git`](https://git-scm.com) (v2+).

Verify Git installation by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

## Email delivery

Hoppscotch comes with support for easy integrations with 3rd party SMTP providers. You will need emails so that you can invite your team to use Hoppscotch and for emails to work, you will need to set up proper SMTP configuration as described below.

To enable email delivery, you will need to generate a valid SMTP URL in the below format:

```
smtps://user@domain.com:pass@smtp.domain.com
```

For example, if you are using Gmail as your SMTP server your SMTP URL will look like something shown below:

```
smtps://user@gmail.com:pass@smtp.gmail.com
```

You can also use [mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) as a simple SMTP server

## Postgres database

Hoppscotch uses a Postgres database to store all the data. You can use any Postgres database provider of your choice - hosted locally or on a cloud provider. Make sure you have a valid Postgres database URL in the below format:

```
postgresql://username:password@url:5432/dbname
```
## ClickHouse

Hoppscotch uses ClickHouse to store all audit logs. You can use a locally hosted ClickHouse instance via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/clickhouse/clickhouse-server) or a [managed instance](https://clickhouse.com/cloud). Ensure that the values for the following environment variables are assigned properly.

```bash
#ClickHouse Config
ALLOW_AUDIT_LOGS=false # set to true to enable audit logging
CLICKHOUSE_HOST=**************
CLICKHOUSE_USER=default
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=''
```

You can disable audit logging from your instance of Hoppscotch by setting the `ALLOW_AUDIT_LOGS` environment variable to `false`. You can read more about audit logs [here](/guides/articles/audit-logs).

## OAuth

You also need to configure an OAuth provider to enable third-party authentication. Hoppscotch supports the following OAuth providers:

1. Email
2. GitHub
3. Google
4. Microsoft
5. SAML SSO

### Choosing OAuth Providers

Hoppscotch provides you with the ability to choose which authentication providers you want to use in the app. You can do this by specifying the required providers in the environment variable

```yaml
VITE_ALLOWED_AUTH_PROVIDERS=GOOGLE,GITHUB,MICROSOFT,EMAIL,SAML
```

### Configuring SAML

You may use services like [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/) or [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) or other services to fetch the following parameters for SAML.

```yaml
SAML_ISSUER=**********
SAML_AUDIENCE=nestjs-saml
SAML_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3170/v1/auth/saml/callback
SAML_CERT=**********
SAML_ENTRY_POINT=**********
SAML_WANT_ASSERTIONS_SIGNED=true
SAML_WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED=false
```

### Configuring third-party providers

To configure the third-party authentication, you will need to generate a valid OAuth client ID and client secret for the OAuth provider of your choice. You will also need to provide a valid callback URL for the OAuth provider.

For example, if you are using GitHub as your OAuth provider, you will need to generate a valid OAuth client ID and client secret for GitHub. You will also need to provide a valid callback URL for GitHub. The environment variables for the GitHub OAuth provider will look like something shown below:

```yaml
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="*****"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="*****"
GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:3170/v1/auth/github/callback"
GITHUB_SCOPE="user:email"
```

The `CALLBACK_URL` variable is the URL that is invoked after the authorization is done and it follows the pattern `http://localhost:3170/v1/auth/[auth_provider_name]/callback`.

The `SCOPE` variable defines the scope of the data that the OAuth provider passes on to Hoppscotch.

By default, public GitHub is used as the OAuth provider. However, an instance of Github Enterprise can also be used as the provider. To configure that, the following environment variables must be set:
- `GITHUB_AUTHORIZATION_URL`: Authorization endpoint.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN_URL`: Endpoint to retrieve access token.
- `GITHUB_USER_PROFILE_URL`: Endpoint to retrieve general user info (e.g., full name).
- `GITHUB_USER_EMAIL_URL`: Endpoint to retrieve user emails.

Sample configuration:
```yaml
# New configuration settings================================================
GITHUB_AUTHORIZATION_URL=https://{{ENTERPRISE_INSTANCE_HOST_NAME}}/login/oauth/authorize
GITHUB_TOKEN_URL=https://{{ENTERPRISE_INSTANCE_HOST_NAME}}/login/oauth/access_token
GITHUB_USER_PROFILE_URL=https:/{{ENTERPRISE_INSTANCE_HOST_NAME}}/api/v3/user
GITHUB_USER_EMAIL_URL=https://{{ENTERPRISE_INSTANCE_HOST_NAME}}/api/v3/user/emails

# Configuration settings that remain unchanged in meaning============================= 
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=*****************************************
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=*****************************************
GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3170/v1/auth/github/callback
GITHUB_SCOPE="user:email"
```

The links to configure OAuth for various providers are given below:

1. [**GitHub**](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) (scope: email)
2. [**Google**](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid#get_your_google_api_client_id) (scope: email, profile)
3. [**Microsoft**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-web-app-sign-user-app-registration?tabs=nodejs#register-an-app-by-using-the-azure-portal) (scope: user with read permission)

- It is recommended that you secure your deployments by issuing TLS certificates and using **HTTPS** since we use **secure HTTP cookies** for authenticating users.

# Setup Hoppscotch

To get started, head to [hoppscotch.io](https://hoppscotch.io) and start using it right away for free.

## Locally served APIs

If you're using Hoppscotch to test your locally served APIs, it is reccomended that you install the [**Hoppscotch Browser Extension**](/documentation/features/interceptor#browser-extension). Read the pre-requisites and follow the steps below to get started.

### Pre-requisites

1. Install the browser extension from the below links:

   - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hoppscotch-browser-extens/amknoiejhlmhancpahfcfcfhllgkpbld?hl=en)
   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hoppscotch)

2. Click on the Hoppscotch Browser Extension icon from browser toolbar and add a new origin as `http://localhost` or `http://localhost:8000` as per your local server configuration.

## Deployed APIs

To test your deployed APIs, you can use the [Hoppscotch Web App](https://hoppscotch.io) without any additional setup.

### Fix CORS errors

If your API is `CORS` enabled, you should switch the interceptor to "**Proxy**" from Settings page or the bottom bar to avoid `CORS` errors.

Proxy mode helps you to:

- Bypass [`CORS`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions
- Hide your IP address
- Access APIs served in non-HTTPS (`http://`) endpoints
- Use your own Proxy middleware URL

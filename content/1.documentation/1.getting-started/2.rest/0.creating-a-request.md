# Creating a request

![REST API platform](/getting-started/rest/rest-api-get-req.gif)

## REST API platform

The REST API platform is the default protocol that is active when you open Hoppscotch. Hoppscotch allows you to make API requests and examine the responses.

You can enter the API endpoint and choose the HTTP method according to your needs from the dropdown menu.
Once it is configured, click on the `Send` button and you will see the response returned by the server. It's that simple.

Now try it yourself, copy the below API endpoint and create a request.

```text
https://echo.hoppscotch.io
```

## Pokemon API

Let's try another API.

We'll be using the Pokemon API, go ahead and create a `GET` request to the endpoint below:

```text
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2
```

If your request was successful, then you should get a JSON response as shown below:

```json
{
  "ability": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/",
  "berry": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/berry/",
  ...
  "pokedex": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokedex/",
  "pokemon": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/",
  ...
  "version-group": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/version-group/"
}
```

The Pokemon API has returned us three new API endpoints or URLs, let's pick the characters URL and explore it.

Now, let's create a `GET` request to the characters URL, append `/pokemon` to the URL you already have on Hoppscotch or copy paste the URL below:

```text
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
```

The API should have returned a huge amount of data, something similar to the one below:

```json
{
  "count": 1279,
  "next": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=20&limit=20",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "bulbasaur",
      "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/"
    },
    {
      "name": "ivysaur",
      "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2/"
    },
    ...
    ...
}
```

Try experimenting with the `/pokedex`, `/berry` and the other sendpoints as well.

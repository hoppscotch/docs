### `Http` Request Header

This can be used in an HTTP request to provide context to a request being made, so that the server can tailor the response.
E.g `Accept-*`vheaders indicate the allowed and preferred formats of the response.
Other Headers can be used to supply Authentication credentials, to control caching, or to get information about the user agent etc..,

## Modifying Request Header

Got to the `Headers` Tab under the URL field and add your Headers to the Header List

## Commonly Used Headers

| Common Headers      | Function                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WWW-Authenticate    | The server may send this as an initial response if it needs some form of authentication before responding with the actual resource being requested.                   |
| Authorization [^1]  | Contains the authentication credentials for HTTP authentication.                                                                                                      |
| Proxy-Authorization | HTTP `Proxy-Authorization` request header contains the credentials to authenticate a user agent to a proxy server                                                     |
| Age                 | Age directive states the maximum amount of time in seconds that fetched responses are allowed to be used again (from the time when a request is made)                 |
| Cache-Control       | The cache policy defined by the server for this response, a cached response can be stored by the client and re-used till the time defined by the Cache-Control header |

[^1]: Hoppscotch automatically manages this header, when you add Auth Credentials to the `Authorization` tab . But in-case the server takes custom type,you can manually your Credentials in this Header.

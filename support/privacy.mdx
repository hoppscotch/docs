## **Cookies and similar technologies.**

Some of the automatic collection described above is facilitated by the following technologies:

* **Cookies** are small text files that websites store on user devices and that allow web servers to record users’ web browsing activities and remember their submissions, preferences, and login status as they navigate a site. Cookies used on our sites include both “session cookies” that are deleted when a session ends, “persistent cookies” that remain longer, “first party” cookies that we place, and “third party” cookies that our third-party business partners and service providers place.   
* **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.   
* **Chat technologies**, such as those provided by Crisp employ cookies and software code to operate the chat features that you can use to communicate with us through the Service.  Crisp and other third parties may access and use information about webpages visited on our website, your IP address, your general geographic information (e.g., city, state), and other personal information you share through online chats for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  
* **Session-replay technologies,** such as those provided by PostHog employ software code to record users’ interactions with the Services in a manner that allows us to watch video replays of those user sessions. The replays include users’ clicks, taps, mouse movements, scrolls, and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement. You can learn more about PostHog and how to opt out of session recording by PostHog at https://posthog.com/privacy.  
* **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.

Hoppscotch Limited is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will not charge you for the app or its services without making it clear to you exactly what you're paying for.

Please note that there are certain things that Hoppscotch Limited will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Hoppscotch Limited cannot take responsibility if the app doesn't work at full functionality due to a lack of Wi-Fi or data allowance.

If you use the app outside an area with Wi-Fi, your terms of agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. By using the app, you're accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you're not the bill payer for the device on which you're using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer to use the app.

Along the same lines, Hoppscotch Limited cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app, such as ensuring that your device stays charged. If your device runs out of battery and you can't turn it on to avail of the service, Hoppscotch Limited cannot accept responsibility.

Concerning Hoppscotch Limited's responsibility for your use of the app, it's important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Hoppscotch Limited accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying solely on the functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on the web and CLI â€“ the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Hoppscotch Limited does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the web & CLI version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the app and terminate its use at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

  Embed Hoppscotch Widgets to create interactive and dynamic elements on your
  website.

Widgets are interactive components that can be embedded in HTML pages to create
a seamless user experience. Hoppscotch offers three types of widgets: links,
buttons, and embeds. These widgets allow you to easily integrate dynamic
environment into your website or project.

## Links

Links are the simplest type of widget. They are just URLs that you can share
with others. You can create links for your requests in three formats: raw, HTML,
and Markdown.

## Buttons

Buttons are a more advanced type of widget that can be embedded in HTML or
Markdown files. You can customize how they look and act to fit your needs.
Buttons can be created in two formats: HTML and Markdown.

## Embeds

Embeds are the most advanced widgets, allowing you to embed a mini version of
Hoppscotch directly into an HTML page. This lets your audience interact directly
with your API requests. You can also customize how the embed looks and functions
to match your preferences.

## Share Request

The **Share Request** feature allows you to create widgets like links, buttons,
and embeds that can be shared with others. When you share a request, it doesn't
give direct access to your actual request instead, it generates a shareable link
that others can use.

<Warning>
  If a shared request uses environment variables, replace them with actual
  values before sharing to ensure it works correctly.
</Warning>

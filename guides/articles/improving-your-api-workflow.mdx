description: Learn how to improve your API workflow with Hoppscotch.

Hoppscotch provides you with a minimal and blazing platform to design, develop and test your APIs. Hoppscotch enables you to quickly get started and even helps you to organize your work to help you improve your workflow.

Hoppscotch provides you with three major ways for you to manage your APIs and enhance your development workflow:

- Collections
- Environments
- Workspaces

## Collections

Collections help you save and organize your API requests. You can create collections and add requests to them to share with your team or to use later. You can also import and export collections from Hoppscotch, OpenAPI, and Postman.

## Environments

Environments provide you the functionality to create key-value pairs that can be used as variables in your request URL, headers, and even as auth tokens. You can create several such key-value pairs and group them under a single environment. Environments are self-isolated from each other and an active environment needs to be selected if you have multiple environments created.

## Workspaces

Workspaces help you organize your requests, collections, and environments for specific purposes and project stages. You can create unlimited Workspaces and invite as many collaborators as needed in Hoppscotch. Whether you’re working solo or with a team, you can choose between **Personal and Team Workspaces** to fit your needs.

A Personal Workspace is a private area exclusively for you, where collaboration isn’t possible. Within a Personal Workspace, you can choose to sync your collections and environment data either with the [Hoppscotch cloud](https://hoppscotch.io) or **keep it stored locally**.

To learn more about setting up new Workspaces and collaborating with your team on APIs, head over to our [documentation for Workspaces](https://docs.hoppscotch.io/documentation/features/workspaces).

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Hoppscotch as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, track issues, and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

**We use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So all code changes happen through pull requests.**

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests.

## Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](/support/code-of-conduct), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org).
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer merge it for you.

#### Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License.

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

#### Report bugs using GitHub's Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/issues); it's that easy!

#### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](https://stackoverflow.com/q/12088905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example](https://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give a sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

#### Use a consistent coding style

I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try using Eslint code extensions in vs code or something similar.

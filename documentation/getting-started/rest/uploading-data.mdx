APIs can also be used to upload encoded content to a server. This is usually done with `PUT` or `POST` methods.

The most common content types are:

- `application/json`: for content in JSON format
- `multipart/form-data`: for uploading encoded files

## Uploading a file

Let us take a look at uploading an image file into an API using hoppscotch.

To upload a file, the data you send in a `POST` request must be of the content types `application/x-www-form-encoded` and `multipart/form-data`.

## Uploading an image

1. Select the `POST` HTTP method and set your API Endpoint URL.
2. Add the necessary headers.
3. To add your image file click in the body tab and select `multipart/form-data` in the content-type dropdown.
4. Give your file a name and click on `choose files` to select your file.
5. Click "**Send**" to upload your file.

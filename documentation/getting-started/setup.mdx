### Deployed APIs

To test your deployed APIs, you can use the [Hoppscotch Web App](https://hoppscotch.io) without any additional setup.

### Locally served APIs

If you're using Hoppscotch web app to test your locally served APIs, it is recommended that you install the [**Hoppscotch Browser Extension**](/documentation/features/interceptor#browser-extension). Read the prerequisites and follow the steps below to get started.

1. Install the browser extension from the below links:

   - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hoppscotch-browser-extens/amknoiejhlmhancpahfcfcfhllgkpbld?hl=en)
   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hoppscotch)

2. Click on the Hoppscotch Browser Extension icon from the browser toolbar and ensure that `hoppscotch.io` is in your active origins. If you are using Hoppscotch Self-Host, add your own domain as a new origin

      <img className="hidden border border-black/5 rounded-md dark:border-white/5 dark:block" src="/images/browser-extension-dark.png" />
    </Frame>

3. Refresh the Hoppscotch web app to apply the changes.
4. Open the interceptor and change the middleware to the browser extension.

    You can either go to the settings and enable the use of the browser extension as shown below:

    <Frame>
      <img className="block border border-black/5 rounded-md dark:border-white/5 dark:hidden" src="/images/browser-extension-enable-1-light.png" />
      <img className="hidden border border-black/5 rounded-md dark:border-white/5 dark:block" src="/images/browser-extension-enable-1-dark.png" />
    </Frame>

    Or you can open the interceptor menu and change the middleware as shown below:

    <Frame>
      <img className="block border border-black/5 rounded-md dark:border-white/5 dark:hidden" src="/images/browser-extension-enable-2-light.png" />
      <img className="hidden border border-black/5 rounded-md dark:border-white/5 dark:block" src="/images/browser-extension-enable-2-dark.png" />
    </Frame>

### Fix CORS errors

If your API is `CORS` enabled, you should switch the interceptor to "**Proxy**" from the Settings page or the bottom bar to avoid `CORS` errors.

Proxy mode helps you to:

- Bypass `CORS` (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.
- Hide your IP address.
- Access APIs served in non-HTTPS endpoints.
- Use your own Proxy middleware URL.

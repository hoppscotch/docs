The Hoppscotch Socket.io testing tool lets you test out your socket.io services.

## Connect to a socket.io server

1. Add the "**URL**", "**path**" and click on "**Connect**".
2. Listen to events broadcasted by the server, shown in the log.
3. Use the sidebar to add an event name and send messages to the server.

## Sending messages

Write your message in the "**Message**" input field under the "**Communication**" tab and click on the "**Send**" button. Type in the "**Event**" input field to send a message with an event name. The message you send will be displayed on the "**Logs**" pane.

## Troubleshooting

1. Make sure you enter a valid socket.io URL, they always start with the protocol format `ws://`.
2. Do not add an invalid/incorrect authorization token before you connect to a socket.io server.

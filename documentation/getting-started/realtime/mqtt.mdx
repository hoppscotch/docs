## Connect to a MQTT server

1. Enter the MQTT server "**URL**" and click on "**Connect**".

    ```
    wss://test.mosquitto.org:8081
    ```

2. Check the log to see if the connection was successful or not.
3. To test your server add messages under a topic and publish it.
4. Other devices in the server that have subscribed to the topic will get your messages.
5. You can receive messages by subscribing to a topic that another device in the server transmits.
6. Monitor the log for results.

## Sending messages

Write your message in the "**Message**" input field under the "**Communication**" tab and click on the "**Publish**" button. Type in the "**Topic**" input field to send a message with a topic. The message you send will be displayed on the "**Logs**" pane.

## Subscriptions

Click on the "**New Subscription**" button to add a new subscription. Enter the topic name and click on the "**Subscribe**" button to subscribe to the topic. The messages you receive will be displayed on the "**Logs**" pane.

## Troubleshooting

1. Make sure you enter a valid MQTT URL, they always start with the protocol format `ws://`.
2. Do not add invalid/incorrect authorization tokens before you connect to a MQTT server.

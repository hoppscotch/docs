The Hoppscotch SSE testing tool lets you test out your SSE services.

## Connect to a SSE server

1. Add the SSE "**URL**" and "**path**" and click on "**Connect**".
2. Choose the event type that you want to subscribe to and connect.
3. Message from the SSE server will continuously updated in the log until either the server or client (you) terminate the connection.

## Listening to events

The events sent by the server will be displayed in the log pane.

## Troubleshooting

1. Make sure you enter valid SSE URLs, they always start with the protocol format `http://` or `https://`.
2. Make sure the server is sending the correct event type.

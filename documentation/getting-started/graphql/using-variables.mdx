Hoppscotch allows you to pass variables in the query to fetch data dynamically.

To demonstrate the use of variables let's write a query to get the Ninja whose id is `61bd1dbc918f12c17b9c6483`.

## Variables

Go to the variables section and define the variable.

```json
{
  "id": "61bd1dbc918f12c17b9c6483"
}
```

## Using the variable in the query

Now create a query `getCharacter` with variables as shown below:

```graphql
 query getCharacter($id:String!){
  character(id:$id) {
    name
    avatarSrc
    rank
    description
    village
  }
}
```

Hoppscotch will retrieve the value of the variable and execute the query to get the below response.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "character": {
      "name": "Aburame Shibi",
      "avatarSrc": "https://narutoql.s3.amazonaws.com/Aburame2.jpg",
      "rank": "Jounin",
      "description": "Aburame Shibi is the father of Aburame Shino. Like his son, his body is also inhabited by the destruction bugs.",
      "village": "leaf village"
    }
  }
}
```

Widgets are small, interactive components that can be embedded in HTML pages to provide a seamless experience for your audience. Hoppscotch offers three types of widgets: links, buttons, and embeds.

## Links

Links are the most basic type of widget. They are simply a URL that can be shared with others. You can generate links to your requests in three different formats: raw, HTML, and Markdown.

## Buttons

Buttons are a more advanced type of widget. They are a link that can be embedded in HTML or Markdown files. You can customize the button's appearance and behavior to suit your needs. You can also generate buttons in three different formats: HTML, and Markdown.

## Embeds

Embeds are the most advanced type of widget. They are a mini version of Hoppscotch that can be embedded in an HTML page, enabling your audience to interact seamlessly with your API request. You can customize the embed's appearance and behavior to suit your needs.

## Shared requests

Sharing a request does not provide others with access to your request. Instead, it generates a link that can be shared with others. It's important to note that if a shared request contains any environment variables, proper functionality may be compromised unless the recipient has access to the same environment variables. Therefore, it is advisable to share requests that do not contain environment variables or replace any environment variables with their corresponding values before sharing.

The Runner is a powerful tool that allows you to run a collection of requests sequentially. You can also configure the run settings to suit your needs.

## Running a Collection

To run a collection:

- Right-click on the collection and select the "**Run Collection**" option.
- Alternatively, hover over the collection name and click on the "**Run Collection**" icon.

You can choose to run the collection from the CLI or through the web interface based on your preference. A new tab will open where you can configure the run settings as described below.

## Run Settings

1. **Delay**: Set an interval delay (in milliseconds) between running each request.
2. **Stop Run if Error Occurs**: The collection run stops if an error is encountered within a script or if there's a problem sending a request.
3. **Persist Responses**: Log response headers and bodies for review after running the collection. Note that persisting responses may impact performance for large collections.
4. **Keep Variable Values**: Persist the variables used in the run, so any updates made to the variables during the run will retain their changes after completion.

## Executing the Run

After setting up your preferences, start the collection runner. A new tab will display, showing real-time execution details, including:

- **Collection**: The name of the collection being executed.
- **Environment**: The active environment at runtime.
- **Duration**: Total time taken to complete the run.
- **Average Response Time**: The mean response time across all requests.

### Running and Post-Run Actions

- **Stop**: Stop the current run at any time.
- **Run Again**: When a run completes, you can restart with the same configurations as needed.
- **New Run**: Stop the current run and restart with new settings.

## Runner Results

The results view provides a comprehensive summary of your collection run, including:

- **Request Status**: Success or failure of each request, along with HTTP status codes.
- **Tests**: Detailed views of tests that passed or failed.
- **Persisted Responses**: If enabled, view headers and bodies by selecting each request; otherwise, this section remains hidden.

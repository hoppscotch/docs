Hoppscotch API Documentation allows you to generate and host public or private documentation for your APIs. It enables your team to collaborate on documentation in real-time, ensuring your API consumers always have the latest information.

## What you can do

- Generate API documentation from your Collections
- Collaborate with your team to edit and refine content
- Support for Markdown descriptions
- Share documentation with your team or the world
- Publish documentation to a public URL
- Organize endpoints with folders and subfolders
- Include example requests and responses
- Code snippets for various languages and frameworks

## Create documentation

You can create documentation directly from your Collections.

1. **Select a Collection**: Choose the collection you want to document.
2. **Write Documentation**: Navigate to Menu > Documentation.
3. **Publish**: Get a shareable link to your documentation by publishing it.

## Collaborative Editing

Invite team members to your workspace to collaborate on documentation. Changes made to the collection are reflected in the documentation, keeping everything in sync.

## Features

### Real-time Updates

Documentation updates automatically as you modify your collection. You need to publish changes to redeploy the documentation.

### Code Snippets

Automatically generated code snippets for various languages and frameworks help developers integrate with your API quickly.

### Example Responses

Display example responses to help users understand what to expect from your API endpoints. You can add multiple examples for different scenarios (e.g., success, error).

### Markdown Support

Use Markdown to add rich text descriptions, images, and links to your documentation, making it easy to read and understand.

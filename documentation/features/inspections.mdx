Hoppscotch inspections offer a powerful solution for debugging API requests, assisting in reducing errors due to misconfigured user inputs. 

Hoppscotch inspections are designed to streamline the process of identifying and rectifying errors stemming from improperly configured API request inputs. When an input section within the application is not properly configured, Inspections will visually alert users by displaying an alert icon. This icon serves as an indicator that potential issues are present in the configuration.

## Inspecting Configuration Errors

Upon clicking the alert icon, the Inspections panel will provide an overview of possible configuration errors that might be hindering the accomplishment of your intended goal and ways to resolve the errors.

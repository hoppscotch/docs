Hoppscotch's REST API platform provides you with a fast and seamless experience to test and debug your API endpoints.

It's primarily divided into two sections along with other features to help you build better APIs.

## Request

The request section provides you the capability to define your API endpoint and initiate the communication.

You can select from a range of HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` etc. You can read more about HTTP methods in [RESTful protocol](/documentation/protocols/rest).

You can also add dynamic behaviors to your requests by specifying `Headers`, `Request Body`, `Authorization Headers`, `Parameters`, and `Pre-request scripts`.

Hoppscotch also provides the capability to run `Tests` on the responses you receive.

## Response

This is where you see the responses to your API endpoints. You can download and copy the returned responses for further use.

## Other features

The REST API platform also houses other features like:

- [Environments](/documentation/features/environments)
- [Collections](/documentation/features/collections)
- [History](/documentation/features/history)

Add client certificates on the [Hoppscotch Desktop App](https://hoppscotch.com/download) to authenticate your identity when connecting to secure APIs.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- The Hoppscotch Desktop App installed on your system.
- A valid Client Certificate in one of the following formats:
    - **.pem Certificate**
    - **.pfx/.pkcs12 Certificate**
- The corresponding private key file, if the certificate is in .pem format.

### Adding Client Certificate

1. Open Hoppscotch's settings page from the side bar
2. Within Interceptors section, locate the `Client Certificates` action under **Native settings**.
3. Click on the option to add a new client certificate and select the type of certificate you want to add: **.pem** or **.pfx/.pkcs12**.
4. **Upload Certificate Files**
    - **.pem Certificate**: Choose the **certificate file** (.crt/.cert/.pem) and upload the **private key file** (.key/.pem) in the designated field.
    - **.pfx/.pkcs12 Certificate**: Choose the **.pfx/.pkcs12** file. You may need to enter the password associated with the certificate file.
5. After uploading the certificate files, click on the save button to store the settings.

<Warning> **You cannot edit a certificate after adding it.** </Warning>

### Using Client Certificate

Once you add the certificate, it will automatically be applied to the configured domain whenever you make an HTTP request. If you wish to disable the certificate for a domain, simply uncheck the corresponding checkbox.

### Removing a certificate

Remove a certificate when no longer needed for sending requests by selecting the **delete icon** located next to the certificate associated with a specific domain.

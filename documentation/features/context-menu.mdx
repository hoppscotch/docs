Context-aware menus enable quick actions like creating variables or adding query
parameters by selecting text or elements. The context menu offers three options:
**Set as Variable**, **Add to Parameters**, and **Open Request in New Tab**.

<Info>
  The "Add to Parameters" option is available only when using query parameters.
</Info>

## Set as Variable

You can use the **Set as Variable** option from the context menu to assign a
selected value to an environment variable.

Hoppscotch supports various variable scopes, including global, environment, and
request-specific variables. For more details on these scopes
[click here](/documentation/features/variables).

### How to use "Set as Variable"

After setting an [environment variable](/documentation/features/environments),
you can reference it using the format `<<variable name>>`. This allows you to
store For example, `<<baseURL>>` can be used to dynamically insert the base URL
across your requests.

## Add to Parameters

The **Add to Parameters** option allows you to quickly add parameters along with
their values.

When you select **Add to Parameters**, it automatically captures the parameter
and its value. For example, if the `baseURL` is
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/?user=1`, now the `user` with ID `1` will
be included in the parameter placeholder.

## Open Request in New Tab

The **Open Request in New Tab** option allows you to open any **selected URL or
text** as a new request in a separate tab..

By opening the selected URL in a new tab, you can continue working on your
original request in its own tab without any interruptions.

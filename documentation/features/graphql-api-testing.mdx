Hoppscotch's GraphQL API platform provides you with the best experience to test and play around with GraphQL.

It's primarily divided into two sections along with other features to help you build and test queries.

## Request

The request section houses the feature to enter your server endpoint and initiate a connection.

Once the connection is made, the `query` builder assists you in designing queries to fetch the data that you require and run it.

You can also add dynamic behavior to your queries by defining `variables`, `headers`, and `authorization`.

## Response

This is where you see the responses to your API endpoints. You can download and copy the returned responses for further use.

## Other features

### Documentation

GraphQL documentation is where you can view the documentation provided by the developer.

### Schema

GraphQL uses a schema to define the structure of the data, the schema explorer helps you to understand how your data is structured.

The GraphQL platform also houses other features like:

- [Environments](/documentation/features/environments)
- [Collections](/documentation/features/collections)
- [History](/documentation/features/history)

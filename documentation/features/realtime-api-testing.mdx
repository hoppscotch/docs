Hoppscotch's Realtime API platform helps you test your real-time APIs easily.

It's primarily divided into two sections the request section and the response section.

## Request

The request section houses the feature to enter your server endpoint and initiate a connection. You also get the option to choose from four different protocols `WebSocket`, `SSE`, `Socket.IO`, and `MQTT`.

## Response

Once the connection is established, you can view the responses and logs in the response section.

Hoppscotch gives you multiple ways to interact with and configure your APIs. With the command-line interface (CLI) you can interact with the Hoppscotch platform using a terminal, or through an automated system. This enables you to run API tests, manage automated API monitoring, and more.

This section contains a complete list of all Hoppscotch CLI commands available, alongside their optional parameters for additional behavior. You can also find a complete list of configuration options to configure your APIs through Hoppscotch.

<Info>Hoppscotch CLI is currently in alpha stage. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/issues/new/choose).</Info>

## Installing Hoppscotch CLI

Once the dependencies are installed, install @hoppscotch/cli from npm by running:

```bash
npm i -g @hoppscotch/cli
```

<Warning>The minimum supported Node.js version for the CLI is v18.</Warning>

## Commands

### `hopp test`

The `hopp test` command allows you to run tests against a Hoppscotch collection file.

- The hopp test command recursively goes through each request in the collection and runs them, validating the responses with the test script provided in each request. Hence, the order of execution is the same as the order specified in the collection structure.
- If upon executing the command, a failed assertion (a failing test case) has occurred, the command will give a non-zero exit code and 0 exit code if all tests have passed.
- Unless there was a network error (for example, DNS resolution errors or network Connectivity Issues), the test script will be running and it is up to the test script to define what happens to error status codes. Non-200 status codes are still considered valid responses for test script execution.

```bash
hopp test [-e <environment file>] [-d <delay_in_ms> ] <hoppscotch collection file>
```

### Running Collections present on the API client

The `hopp test` command can also be used to run collections present in your API client on Hoppscotch cloud or self-hosted platforms.
Do note that you need to create a personal access token for your CLI to connect to your API client, and you can not run collections present in your personal workspace.

```bash
hopp test  [-e <environment id>] [-d <delay_i_ms>] <hoppscotch collection id> [--token <access_token>] [--server <server url>]
```

<Tip> You can directly copy the command with the auto-populated **Collection ID** and **Environment ID** by navigating to the **“CLI"** tab within the **“Run Collection”** action found in the context menu. </Tip>


### Arguments

- `hoppscotch collection id` : Each collection created in a Hoppscotch workspace is given a unique identifier known as the Collection ID. Collection IDs for each collection can be found under **“Details”** tab inside Collection **“Properties”**.
    
- `environment id` : Similar to Collection IDs, each environment created in a Hoppscotch workspace is assigned a unique identifier known as the Environment ID.
- `delay_i_ms` : Represents a time interval (in milliseconds) to pause execution of API requests before within a collection.
- `access token` : It is a secure, unique identifier used to authenticate a user's access to their Hoppscotch account and its resources like collections, environments data. [Learn more about personal access tokens](/documentation/features/pat)
- `server url` : This optional and is the URL of your self-hosted instance when you're self-hosting your API client

### Example

```bash
hopp test kitchen-sink-hoppscotch-collection.json
hopp test -e environment.json kitchen-sink-hoppscotch-collection.json
hopp test -e environment.json -d 1000 kitchen-sink-hoppscotch-collection.json
hopp test clxsntdgh0000lcx9fnits2h8 --token <access token> 
hopp test -e clxspay2r0006lcx99aqgjbay -d 1000 clxsntdgh0000lcx9fnits2h8 --token <access token> --server http://localhost:3170
```

## Environment

Hoppscotch allows templates in several places. For example, you could specify your endpoint URL as `<<baseurl>>/post` and specify baseurl as [`https://echo.hoppscotch.io`](https://echo.hoppscotch.io) in an environment file.

Hoppscotch CLI supports environment files in two specific formats:

### 1. Single Environment Entry Export Format

This format is generated by Hoppscotch App when you export any of your environment. It includes a named environment (name) with key-value pairs, allowing you to define various variables within a single file.
  ```json
  {
    "name": "my_env",
    "variables": [
      {
        "key": "base_url",
        "value": "https://echo.hoppscotch.io"
      },
      {
        "key": "auth_token",
        "value": "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
### 2. Legacy Export Format

Hoppscotch CLI continues to support the legacy format which was previously the only accepted format used by CLI.
```json
{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2",
  "key3": "value3"
}
```

### 3. Environment ID

To use an environment on your API client using its ID, click on the `Properties` action present in the **menu icon** next to each environment. Within the Details section, you'll find the **Environment ID**. Copy this ID and use it in the Hoppscotch CLI for execution.

<Note>Please note that the Hoppscotch CLI exclusively supports the above three formats for importing environment variables. It **does not** offer compatibility with **Bulk Environment** exports or **any other export** format.</Note>

## Secrets

If requests in a collection consists of secret variables we recommend either of the two approaches.

1. Inject the secret values as variables into the OS environment
2. Edit the environment export file and add the secret values manually

|`--token`        | Expects a personal access token to be passed for establishing connection with your Hoppscotch account.                             |
|`--server`       | URL of your self-hosted instance, if your collections are on a self-hosted instance.                                                       |

## Test Report Components


Upon executing the commands, a comprehensive test report is generated, offering detailed insights into the performance of each request. Below, you'll find a breakdown of the components outlined in the test summary for the exported API Collection:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Test Cases" icon="square-1">
    Each instance of `pw.expect()` within the testScript of a request is considered a test case.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Suites" icon="square-2">
    Each invocation of `pw.test()` within the testScript of a request is regarded as a test suite.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Scripts" icon="square-3">
    The total number of `testScript` fields across all requests in the provided collection export file, representing the overall number of test scripts executed.
  </Card>

    The total time taken to execute all test cases within the collection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Requests" icon="square-5">
    The total number of requests executed within the collection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Requests Duration" icon="square-6">
    The cumulative time taken to execute all requests within the collection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pre-request Scripts" icon="square-7">
    The scripts executed prior to each request. The count matches the number of requests in the provided collection export file.

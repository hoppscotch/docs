<Tip>If you're interested in deploying <ins>Hoppscotch on Kubernetes</ins>, you can conveniently skip this guide and proceed directly to the [Helm chart deployment guide](/documentation/self-host/helm-chart-deployment/getting-started).</Tip>

## Configuring the environment

Before you get started with the installation, you need to configure the environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

<Warning>**<u>Ensure that the environment values are not enclosed within quotes [""].</u>**</Warning>
<Note>To enable desktop app support for self-hosted instances, make sure you've enabled [subpath based access](#subpath-based-access).</Note>

Let's understand the major environment variables:

1. `ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY`: The license key required to use Hoppscotch Enterprise.
2. `DATABASE_URL`: This is where you add your Postgres database URL.
3. `HOPP_AIO_ALTERNATE_PORT`: This is an optional variable that lets you specify an alternate port for the AIO container's endpoint when operating in subpath access mode. By default, this endpoint is exposed on port 80.
4. `HORIZONTAL_SCALING`: Set to true to enable horizontal scaling, which uses Redis for managing pub-sub and state across instances.
5. `TOKEN_SALT_COMPLEXITY`: Defines the complexity of the SALT that is used for hashing - a higher number implies a more complex salt.
6. `MAGIC_LINK_TOKEN_VALIDITY`: Duration of the validity of the magic link being sent to sign in to Hoppscotch (in days).
7. `REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY`: Validity of the refresh token for auth (in ms).
8. `ACCESS_TOKEN_VALIDITY`: Validity of the access token for auth (in ms).
9. `JWT_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret Keys for security purposes.
10. `ALLOW_SECURE_COOKIES`: If disabled users will be able to use Hoppscotch over HTTP connections as well. It is recommended that this be left enabled as some auth providers may not work if this value is set to true.
11. `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: A 32-character key used for encrypting sensitive data stored in the database.
12. `REDIRECT_URL`: This is a fallback URL to debug when the actual redirects fail.
11. `WHITELISTED_ORIGINS`: URLs of Hoppscotch backend, admin dashboard, frontend app and the bundle server that are allowed to interact with the desktop app.
14. `VITE_ALLOWED_AUTH_PROVIDERS`: Allows you to specify which auth providers you want to enable.
15. `MAILER_SMTP_ENABLE`: Enables the SMTP mailer configuration.
16. `MAILER_USE_CUSTOM_CONFIGS`: When custom mailer configurations are used.
17. `MAILER_SMTP_URL`: The SMTP URL for email delivery.
18. `MAILER_ADDRESS_FROM`: The email address that you would be using.
19. `MAILER_SMTP_HOST`: The SMTP host.
20. `MAILER_SMTP_PORT`: The port to connect to the SMTP server.
21. `MAILER_SMTP_USER`: The SMTP user or email for authentication.
22. `MAILER_SMTP_PASSWORD`: Provide the password set for the SMTP user.
23. `RATE_LIMIT_TTL`: The time it takes to refresh the maximum number of requests being received.
24. `RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: The maximum number of requests that Hoppscotch can handle under `RATE_LIMIT_TTL`.
25. `VITE_BASE_URL`: This is the URL where your deployment will be accessible from.
26. `VITE_SHORTCODE_BASE_URL`: A URL to generate shortcodes for sharing, can be the same as `VITE_BASE_URL`.
27. `VITE_BACKEND_GQL_URL`: The URL for GraphQL within the instance.
28. `VITE_BACKEND_WS_URL`: The URL for WebSockets within the instance.
29. `VITE_BACKEND_API_URL`: The URL for REST APIs within the instance.
30. `VITE_APP_TOS_LINK` and `VITE_APP_PRIVACY_POLICY_LINK` are optional and are used to configure the links to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.

Third-party auth configs have to be obtained from the respective providers. You can choose and configure the auth providers by following the [configuring OAuth guide](/documentation/self-host/enterprise-edition/prerequisites#oauth).

## Docker

Once the environment variables are configured, you may proceed to the next step of setting up the Hoppscotch instance. Currently, there are two ways to set up Hoppscotch:

- Using individual containers for the services
- Using the AIO container

- Before proceeding further, ensure that you have a running instance of Postgres.

### Using individual containers for the services

To self-host Hoppscotch Enterprise Edition, you will need the following services running via Docker:

- Hoppscotch enterprise frontend
- Hoppscotch enterprise backend
- Hoppscotch enterprise admin dashboard

Pull the containers from DockerHub with the following command:

```bash
docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-frontend
docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-backend
docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-admin
```

After pulling the containers, start Hoppscotch by running all three services:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-frontend
docker run -p 3170:3170 --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-backend
docker run -p 3100:3100 --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-admin
```

<Tip>Ensure that the environment variables are configured in the `.env` file and the restart policy is mentioned.</Tip>

<Note>
To enable desktop app support for your self-hosted Hoppscotch instance, make sure you expose the web app server which is a part of the frontend container. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3200:3200 --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped hoppscotch/hoppscotch-frontend
```
</Note>

Open [admin dashboard](http://localhost:3100) or [`PORT 3100`](http://localhost:3100) in the browser to [setup and access](/documentation/self-host/enterprise-edition/setup-and-access) the Hoppscotch instance.

### Using the AIO container

The All-In-One (AIO) container is a single container that provides all the services required to run Hoppscotch.

Pull the container from DockerHub with the following command:

```bash
docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise
```

After pulling the container, start Hoppscotch by running the container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3100:3100 -p 3170:3170 --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise
```

<Tip>Ensure that the environment variables are configured in the `.env` file and the restart policy is mentioned.</Tip>

Open [admin dashboard](http://localhost:3100) or [`PORT 3100`](http://localhost:3100) in the browser to [setup and access](/documentation/self-host/community-edition/setup-and-access) the Hoppscotch instance.

## Subpath Based Access

To enable subpath based access the following `.env` variable must be set to true, it is set to false by default.

```
ENABLE_SUBPATH_BASED_ACCESS=true
```

<Note>To enable desktop app support for your self-hosted Hoppscotch instance, make sure to set `ENABLE_SUBPATH_BASED_ACCESS` to `true` in your `.env` file.</Note>

When set to true the following is the expected behavior:

### Using individual containers for the services

When using the individual containers it is up to the users to configure a reverse proxy to allow requests made to a specific route to be rerouted to the relevant containers.

### Using the AIO container

When using AIO, when subpath access is set to true the services can be accessed from the following routes

| Service              | Route      |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Hoppscotch App       | `/`        |
| Hoppscotch Admin App | `/admin`   |
| Hoppscotch Backend   | `/backend` |


<Warning>
By default, the AIO container exposes the app on port 80. This can cause conflicts if you're running on a host system where
port 80 is privileged, such as with Rootless Docker, Podman, or hardened environments like OpenShift. If you experience issues on these setups, try setting `HOPP_AIO_ALTERNATE_PORT` to bind the app to a non-privileged port.
</Warning>

## Migrations

Once the instance of Hoppscotch is up, you need to run migrations on the database to ensure that it has the relevant tables. Depending on how Hoppscotch was set up, the method to run the migrations changes.

### Using individual containers for the services

Run the following command to copy the ID of the **backend container**:

```bash
docker ps
```

### Using the AIO container

Run the following command to copy the ID of the **AIO container**:

```bash
docker ps
```

### Running migrations

Once the respective container ID is copied, execute the following command to open an interactive shell within the AIO container to execute the migration command:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
```

Once inside the container, run the migration using:

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma migrate deploy
```

Should the user ever encounter the following error:

```bash
Database migration not found. Please check the documentation for assistance: https://docs.hoppscotch.io/documentation/self-host/community-edition/install-and-build#running-migrations
```

It means the user is trying to start the backend (or AIO) service before the database has all the relevant tables in it. In order to run the migration to populate the database run the following command.

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint sh --env-file .env <container_name>
```

Making sure to pass in the `.env` file containing the right `.env` variables for the instance. On executing the aforementioned command will result in a shell being opened inside a instance of the container following which user can execute a database migration normally with

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma migrate deploy
```

Once the database has been successfully run and the database populated with tables the backend containers ( or AIO container) can be started normally.

Note: If user is using `docker compose` to run the services the following command can be used to open a shell inside the backend (or AIO) service.

```bash
docker compose run --entrypoint sh <Service_name>
```

## ClickHouse setup

To start saving the [audit logs](/guides/articles/audit-logs) into ClickHouse, first you need to create the relevant databases with the relevant tables in them. Follow the following instructions to set up ClickHouse to start saving logs:

1. Ensure that all the relevant containers are running.

2. Run the following command to get the ID of the ClickHouse container:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

3. Once the ClickHouse container is also running, open an interactive bash into it using the `clickhouse-client`:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <clickhouse_container_id> clickhouse-client
   ```

4. Once inside the container, execute the following SQL commands:

   ```sql
   # Create a database called logs
   CREATE DATABASE logs

   # Create a table called audit_logs in the logs database
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS logs.audit_logs
   (
       `event` String,
       `timestamp` DateTime,
       `user` Tuple(id String, email String, name String),
       `group` Tuple(type LowCardinality(String), id String),
       `resource` Tuple(type LowCardinality(String), metadata String),
       `statusCode` Int16,
       `errorMessage` String,
       `result` LowCardinality(String),
       `server_version` String
   )
   ENGINE = MergeTree
   ORDER BY timestamp
   ```
## SAML Configuration
When you use SAML authentication, by default Hoppscotch only pulls the email of the user as the platform uses it as the unique identifier to verify the user.
Starting from `v2024.9.2` onwards, Hoppscotch Enterprise Edition instances support pulling the following attributes from the SAML response to fill in additional user details:

- `displayName`: The name of the user which is displayed within the Hoppscotch platform.
- `photoURL`: The URL where to find the user's profile picture. **Do not** set this attribute if a profile picture doesn't exist.
- `isAdmin` (optional): A boolean attribute (true or false) that automatically assigns the Admin role to users who belong to a designated group in the configured Identity Provider (e.g., Okta).

<Note> The `isAdmin` attribute is evaluated only during the user's first login or signup. Subsequent logins or signups will not re-evaluate this flag. </Note>

| Name         | Name Format | Value                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------|
| displayName  | Basic       | user.displayName                                            |
| photoURL     | Basic       | user.profileURL                                             |
| isAdmin      | Basic       | isMemberOfGroupName("Hoppscotch Admins") ? "true" : "false" |

You have to configure your **SAML IdP (Identity Provider)** to include these attributes _exactly_ in the response. For example, for Okta, you can follow [this guide](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/How-to-define-and-configure-a-custom-SAML-attribute-statement?language=en_US) to configure the attributes.

The **Activity Logs** feature enables workspace members to track and review changes made to collections and requests within a workspace. Actions performed by workspace members are logged and categorized for better visibility.

## Accessing Activity Logs

To access Activity Logs in a workspace:

1. Navigate to the specific workspace from the workspace switcher present in the top right corner of the app.
2. Locate and click on the **clock** icon in the right sidebar.
3. In the `History` tab, you will find a chronological timeline of all changes made to collections and requests.
4. Logs are ordered from the latest to the oldest for easier navigation, with entries grouped by date.

## Permissions

- **OWNER** and **EDITOR** roles: Actions performed by users with these roles are logged.
- **VIEWER** role: Viewers cannot make changes, but they can view the activity logs of changes made by others.

Activity Logs track the following actions within the workspace:

**Activity Logs** provide a clear record of actions performed within a workspace, including changes to collections, requests, and user interactions. These logs help maintain visibility and traceability of modifications across the workspace.

## Configuring Activity Logs

Activity Logs are controlled via a unified toggle in the Admin Dashboard.
1. Go to **Admin Dashboard â†’ Logging Configurations.**
2. **Enable the toggle** in this section to start recording Activity Logs.

<Note> Activity Logs operate independently and do not require ClickHouse credentials. However, if Audit Logs are needed, [ClickHouse credentials must be configured](/documentation/self-host/enterprise-edition/prerequisites#clickhouse). </Note>

## Accessing Activity Logs

To access Activity Logs in a workspace:

1. Navigate to the specific workspace from the workspace switcher present in the top right corner of the app.
2. Locate and click on the **clock** icon in the right sidebar.
3. In the `History` tab, you will find a chronological timeline of all changes made to collections and requests.
4. Logs are ordered from the latest to the oldest for easier navigation, with entries grouped by date.

## Permissions

- **OWNER** and **EDITOR** roles: Actions performed by users with these roles are logged.
- **VIEWER** role: Viewers cannot make changes, but they can view the activity logs of changes made by others.

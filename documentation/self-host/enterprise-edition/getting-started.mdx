Enterprise Edition builds on top of the Community Edition foundation by adding powerful features designed for larger organizations that require robust security measures like SAML-based SSO, OIDC, audit logs, and on-premise deployment options. It also comes with dedicated support to help adapt Hoppscotch to your companyâ€™s specific needs. The self-hosted enterprise version is open-core in nature, meaning it is accompanied by a set of advanced features that are only available through a commercial license.

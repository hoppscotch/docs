- Insights Dashboard: Gain valuable insights into platform usage.
- Manage Users: Handle user-related actions, such as inviting, elevating admins, and deleting users.
- Manage Workspaces: Create, edit, and delete workspaces while managing workspace-specific details and user memberships.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard section provides an overview of essential metrics and statistics regarding users, workspaces, and activity. This snapshot allows you to track the usage and performance of your platform.

Get insights into your organization's usage of Hoppscotch.

- Number of Users: Monitor the count of registered users.
- Number of Workspaces: Keep track of the total number of workspaces.
- Number of Requests: Measure the volume of requests made by your organization.
- Number of Collections: Track the quantity of collections within the platform.

## Manage users

The Users section empowers you to effectively control user-related actions. It streamlines the process of user management, making it simple to oversee the user base. 

<Info>In Hoppscotch community edition, any user can create an account and use the platform.</Info>

- User List: View a comprehensive list of all users on your platform.
- Invite Users: Send invitations to new users, welcoming them to the platform.
- Admin Privileges: Elevate users to administrative roles for increased permissions.

### Invite Users to your Hoppscotch Instance
Admins can easily bring new users to their Hoppscotch instance by sending them invitations. Depending on whether SMTP is configured, the process differs slightly. Here's how you can invite users:

#### - With SMTP Configured
When SMTP is enabled (`MAILER_SMTP_ENABLE=true`) in your environment file and the required SMTP configurations for email login are correctly set, follow these steps to invite a new user:
1. Go to the **Users** section within the Admin Dashboard.
2. Select the **Invite User** button to open the invitation modal.
3. Input the email address of the user you want to invite and click **Add User** to send an invitation.
4. An email containing an invite link (`http://localhost:3000`) will be sent to the invitee. They can use this link to log in to Hoppscotch web app.
5. Alternatively, you can copy the invite link and share it through other platforms with the new user, but make sure the user signs in using the email address specified during the invitation process.
#### - Without SMTP Configured
If SMTP is disabled (`MAILER_SMTP_ENABLE=false`) in your environment file, the invitation process is slightly different:
1. Go to the **Users** section within the Admin Dashboard.
2. Select the **Invite User** button to open the invitation modal.
3. Input the email address of the user you want to invite and click **Add User**.
4. An invite link (`http://localhost:3000`) will be generated and displayed before you. Copy this link and share it with the user via your preferred communication channel. Make sure that the user signs in to Hoppscotch using the same email address you provided during the invitation.

### Pending Invites
Within the **Users** section, admins can view a list of all users who have been invited but have not yet joined the organization. To access this list, simply click on the **Pending Invites** button next to "Invite User". Here, you’ll see all the invitations you've sent, along with details such as:
- **Invitee Email:** The email address to which the invite was sent.
- **Invited By:** The email address of the user who sent the invitation
- **Invited on:** The date and time when the invitation was sent.

<Icon icon="right-to-bracket" iconType="solid" /> **You can also consider the following actions:**

- **Copy Invite Link:** If you need to resend the invitation, you can easily `copy` the invite link and share it with the user via any communication platform.
- **Revoke Invitation:** If you wish to cancel an invitation, simply click the `Revoke Invitation` button next to the specific user invite in the **Action** column. This will remove the pending invite from the list and prevent the user from accessing your Hoppscotch instance using that link.

### APIs for User Management

The RESTful APIs designed for User Management enable **admins** to perform a wide range of user-related actions, such as inviting new users, deleting existing ones, and updating user details. These APIs provide **admins** with the ability to efficiently manage user accounts and permissions. The table below introduces **nine** key APIs that empower **admins** with greater control over user management.

| User Activity | Description | Method | Endpoint | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Invite a New User | Allows admins to invite a new user to the instance. | POST | `<base-url>/v1/infra/user-invitations` | 
| View Pending Invites | Retrieves a list of all pending invites sent to new users. | GET | `<base-url>/v1/infra/user-invitations` | 
| Delete Pending Invites | Enables admins to delete specific pending invites using their Email ID. | DELETE | `<base-url>/v1/infra/user-invitations` | 
| View All Users | Provides a list of all users in the instance. | GET | `<base-url>/v1/infra/users` | 
| View a Particular User | Fetches details of a specific user in the instance by their User ID. | GET | `<base-url>/v1/infra/users/{uid}` | 
| Delete an existing User | Enables admins to delete an existing user from the instance by their User ID. | DELETE | `<base-url>/v1/infra/users/{uid}` |
| Update User Details | Allows admins to update the details of an existing user. | PATCH | `<base-url>/v1/infra/users/{uid}` |
| Manage Admin Status | Enables admins to add or remove admin status for an existing user. | PATCH | `<base-url>/v1/infra/users/{uid}/admin-status` | 
| Fetch User’s involvement in Workspaces | Retrieves workspace details that a user is part of, including their role. | GET | `<base-url>/v1/infra/users/{uid}/workspaces` |

### InfraTokens

InfraTokens are special UUID tokens that provide a secure way for admins to interface with Self-Hosted APIs. They are exclusively accessible to admins, ensuring that only authorized personnel can manage sensitive operations. Unlike Personal Access Tokens, which are tied to individual users, InfraTokens are scoped at the instance level, granting access to all admins within the instance.

#### Steps to Generate an InfraToken

Follow these steps to create a new InfraToken:

1. After logging into your Self-Hosted instance using your admin credentials, you can access the **“Tokens”** under the **“Settings”** section from your admin dashboard.
2. Click on **"Generate New InfraToken."**
3. Enter a title for the token and select an expiration date. Available options include 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or no expiry.
4. After providing the necessary details, confirm the creation. **The new InfraToken will be displayed once, make sure to copy it securely** to your clipboard for immediate use.
5. If you decide that you no longer need the token, you can delete it by navigating back to **“Tokens"** section.

<Note> The details of the admin who created the InfraToken are stored for audit purposes. All admins can view and manage these tokens. </Note>

#### How to Use InfraTokens
InfraTokens are to be used as **Bearer tokens**. When making requests to the User Management APIs, include the `InfraToken` in the `Authorization` header as follows:

```bash
Bearer <Your_InfraToken>
```

## Manage Workspaces

In the Manage Workspace section, you can efficiently handle workspace-related operations, ensuring that collaborations and projects run smoothly.

- Workspace Creation: Establish new workspace tailored to specific projects or departments.
- Workspace Editing: Modify workspace details and configurations as needed.
- Workspace Deletion: Disband workspaces that are no longer relevant.
- User Memberships: View and manage the users associated with each workspace.

## Server Settings

In the **Server Settings** section, you have the ability to both view and edit the environment variables that were configured during the setup of your self-hosted instance.

### Configurations

1. **Configure Authentication Providers:**
   Customize authentication providers, including Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and email, directly from the settings page.

2. **Configure SMTP Settings:**
   Set up your SMTP settings for seamless email integration.

3. **Reset Configurations:**
   If needed, reset your configurations back to their original state.

After making any configuration updates, be sure to save the changes. The server will automatically restart to apply the modifications.

## Hard Reset Configurations

If you need to perform a hard reset of the server configurations, execute the following command in your terminal to reset all your environment variables:

```bash
docker exec -it <db_container_id> psql -d hoppscotch -c "TRUNCATE \"InfraConfig\";"
```

You can replace `<db_container_id>` with the actual ID of your Docker container.

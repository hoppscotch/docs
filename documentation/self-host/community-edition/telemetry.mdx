Telemetry in Hoppscotch Self-Host refers to anonymous data shared with Hoppscotch. This helps identify the usage patterns of Hoppscotch.

# Data Collected by Hoppscotch

Hoppscotch does not capture any data from your APIs. All captured data is anonymous and pertains to instance usage.

## Instance Usage

The instance usage ping is sent once a week to indicate that the instance is operational. You can disable this event by navigating to the settings page and turning off data sharing settings.

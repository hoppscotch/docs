## Configuring the environment

Before you get started with the installation, you need to configure the environment variables.

Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file found in the root directory of the cloned repository to `.env` and add your values for the environment variables.

<Warning>**Ensure that the environment values are not enclosed within quotes ("").**</Warning>

```yaml
#-----------------------Backend Config------------------------------#

```

Let's understand the major environment variables:

1. `DATABASE_URL`: This is where you add your Postgres database URL.
2. `TOKEN_SALT_COMPLEXITY`: Defines the complexity of the SALT that is used for hashing - a higher number implies a more complex salt.
3. `MAGIC_LINK_TOKEN_VALIDITY`: Duration of the validity of the magic link being sent to sign in to Hoppscotch (in days).
4. `REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY`: Validity of the refresh token for auth (in ms).
5. `ACCESS_TOKEN_VALIDITY`: Validity of the access token for auth (in ms).
6. `JWT_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret Keys for security purposes.
7. `REDIRECT_URL`: This is a fallback URL to debug when the actual redirects fail.
8. `WHITELISTED_ORIGINS`: URLs of Hoppscotch backend, admin dashboard, and the frontend app.
9. `VITE_ALLOWED_AUTH_PROVIDERS`: Allows you to specify which auth providers you want to enable.
10. `MAILER_SMTP_URL`: The SMTP URL for email delivery.
11. `MAILER_ADDRESS_FROM`: The email address that you would be using.
12. `RATE_LIMIT_TTL`: The time it takes to refresh the maximum number of requests being received.
13. `RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: The maximum number of requests that Hoppscotch can handle under `RATE_LIMIT_TTL`.
14. `VITE_BASE_URL`: This is the URL where your deployment will be accessible from.
15. `VITE_SHORTCODE_BASE_URL`: A URL to generate shortcodes for sharing, can be the same as `VITE_BASE_URL`.
16. `VITE_BACKEND_GQL_URL`: The URL for GraphQL within the instance.
17. `VITE_BACKEND_WS_URL`: The URL for WebSockets within the instance.
18. `VITE_BACKEND_API_URL`: The URL for REST APIs within the instance.
19. `VITE_APP_TOS_LINK` and `VITE_APP_PRIVACY_POLICY_LINK` are optional and are used to configure the links to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.

Third-party auth configs have to be obtained from the respective providers. You can choose and configure the auth providers by following the [configuring OAuth guide](/documentation/self-host/community-edition/prerequisites#oauth).

## Docker

Once the environment variables are configured, you may proceed to the next step of setting up the Hoppscotch instance. Currently, there are two ways to set up Hoppscotch:

1. Using individual containers for the services.
2. Using the AIO container.

- Before proceeding further, ensure that you have a running instance of Postgres.

### Using individual containers for the services

To self-host Hoppscotch Community Edition, you will need the following services running via Docker:

- Hoppscotch frontend
- Hoppscotch backend
- Hoppscotch admin dashboard

Pull the containers from DockerHub with the following command:

```bash
docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-frontend
docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-backend
docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-admin
```

After pulling the containers, start Hoppscotch by running all three services:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped hoppscotch-frontend
docker run -p 3170:3170 --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped hoppscotch-backend
docker run -p 3100:3100 --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped hoppscotch-admin
```

- Ensure that the environment variables are configured in the `.env` file and the restart policy is mentioned.

Open [admin dashboard](http://localhost:3100) or [`PORT 3100`](http://localhost:3100) in the browser to [setup and access](/documentation/self-host/community-edition/setup-and-access) the Hoppscotch instance.

### Using the AIO container

The All-In-One (AIO) container is a single container that provides all the services required to run Hoppscotch.

Pull the container from DockerHub with the following command:

```bash
docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch
```

After pulling the container, start Hoppscotch by running the container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3100:3100 -p 3170:3170 --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped hoppscotch/hoppscotch
```

- Ensure that the environment variables are configured in the `.env` file and the restart policy is mentioned.

Open [admin dashboard](http://localhost:3100) or [`PORT 3100`](http://localhost:3100) in the browser to [setup and access](/documentation/self-host/community-edition/setup-and-access) the Hoppscotch instance.

## Subpath Based Access

To enable subpath based access the following `.env` variable must be set to true, it is set to false by default.

```
ENABLE_SUBPATH_BASED_ACCESS=false
```

When set to true the following is the expected behavior:

### Using individual containers for the services

When using the individual containers it is up to the users to configure a reverse proxy to allow requests made to a specific route to be rerouted to the relevant containers.

### Using the AIO container

When using AIO, when subpath access is set to true the services can be accessed from the following routes

| Service              | Route      |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Hoppscotch App       | `/`        |
| Hoppscotch Admin App | `/admin`   |
| Hoppscotch Backend   | `/backend` |

## Migrations

Once the instance of Hoppscotch is up, you need to run migrations on the database to ensure that it has the relevant tables. Depending on how Hoppscotch was set up, the method to run the migrations changes.

### Using individual containers for the services

Run the following command to copy the ID of the **backend container**:

```bash
docker ps
```

### Using the AIO container

Run the following command to copy the ID of the **AIO container**:

```bash
docker ps
```

### Running migrations

Once the respective container ID is copied, execute the following command to open an interactive shell within the container to execute the migration command:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
```

Once inside the container, run the migration using:

```bash
pnpx prisma migrate deploy
```

Should the user ever encounter the following error:

```bash
Database migration not found. Please check the documentation for assistance: https://docs.hoppscotch.io/documentation/self-host/community-edition/install-and-build#running-migrations
```

It means the user is trying to start the backend (or AIO) service before the database has all the relevant tables in it. In order to run the migration to populate the database run the following command.

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint sh --env-file .env <container_name>
```

Making sure to pass in the `.env` file containing the right `.env` variables for the instance. On executing the aforementioned command will result in a shell being opened inside a instance of the container following which user can execute a database migration normally with

```bash
pnpx prisma migrate deploy
```

Once the database has been successfully run and the database populated with tables the backend containers ( or AIO container) can be started normally.

Note: If user is using `docker compose` to run the services the following command can be used to open a shell inside the backend (or AIO) service.

```bash
docker compose run --entrypoint sh <Service_name>
```
